My own website, I have developed this with the help of HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript.

Hello, I am Swapnil Singh. 
The process of scientific discovery is, in effect, a continual flight from wonder. The Universe and The Physical Laws made me curious to my core and all I've wanted to do since then is to study the world around me.
I am a Second year Undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering from BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore, Karnataka, India. From my childhood I was curious about space and was furious to do something.

As I started my Undergraduate study in the month of Janâ€™22, I started getting involved in Research projects related to Astrophysics and Theoretical Physics and with deep fascination I have learned a lot from the project with this I have gained knowledge of research methodology, have a working understanding of Cosmos, Physics and mathematics concepts.
